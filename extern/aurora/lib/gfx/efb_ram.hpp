// Hardware-accurate EFB copies to main memory ("EFB copies to texture + RAM").
//
// GXCopyTex keeps its fast GPU texture (possibly upscaled), keyed by destination pointer.
// This module adds what the console does besides: the copy's texels exist as GX-format
// bytes (tiled, big-endian) at the destination in main memory.
//
//  * GPU consumers: a texture that reads a copy's memory with a different format, size or
//    offset than the copy (e.g. a Z16 depth copy sampled as IA8) is decoded from those
//    exact bytes, at native resolution, in the same frame (GPU encode + decode, no stall).
//  * CPU consumers: copies into ranges the guest reads with the CPU (DCInvalidateRange, or
//    every copy when readback-all is on) are read back asynchronously and written into
//    memory once the GPU has finished the frame (writeback skipped when the CPU has written
//    the range since the copy).
//  * CPU/DMA writes into a copy's range (detected by hashing the range) drop the copy, so a
//    texture loaded there afterwards comes from memory.
