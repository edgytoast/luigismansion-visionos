// Pipeline precaching (lib/gfx/pipeline_cache.cpp).
//
// Render pipelines (WGSL generated from the GX TEV/vertex state + blend/depth state) are
// created on worker threads. Every pipeline config ever used is remembered in
// <cachePath>/pipeline_cache.db and all of them are rebuilt in the background at startup
// (and again when the render target layout, the GX accuracy flags or the enhanced-lighting
// parts that select shader variants change; 0217: each recorded config is expanded into the
// variants the current settings produce), so draws
// normally find their pipeline ready. A draw whose pipeline is still being compiled waits
// for it instead of being skipped (a hitch, never a missing object).
